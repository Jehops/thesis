  \caption[The first ten codons of a gene sequence and their associated amino acids.]{The first ten codons of a gene sequence and their associated amino acids.  At the top is wild-type allele, \emph{A}.  Mutant allele \emph{a} is a copy of \emph{A}, except that a single-nucleotide mutation changed codon GAG to GTG, substituting the amino acid Glutamate with Valine in the protein.}
